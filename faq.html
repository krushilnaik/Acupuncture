				<h3>How does acupuncture work?</h3>
				Its theoretical basis is that everyone is born with a fixed amount of energy at birth.
				The Qi flows through the body along invisible pathways referred to as “meridians”.
				Chinese Medicine is based on the discovery that certain areas of the skin are related to internal body organs and specific bodily functions.
				Insertion of very fine needles, sometimes combined with electrical stimulation and heat, unblocks and stimulates energy so it flows freely again.
			</div>

			<div class="service">
				<h3>Why do we need to feel your pulse?</h3>
				There are 12 pulse positions on each wrist that your acupuncturist will palpate. Each position corresponds to s specific meridian and organ.
				Your acupuncturist will be looking for 27 individual qualities that reflect overall health. If there are any problems, they may appear in the pulse.
			</div>

			<div class="service">
				<h3>What is Qi?</h3>
				Qi is the substance of life. As the basis of the universe’s infinite manifestations, Qi is present in all life forms.
				Pathways of Qi run throughout the body and are known as meridians or channels. Each channel is linked to a particular organ.
				These channels are the paths along which Qi flows, supplying life and energy to every cell.
				When systemic Qi flow is blocked, disharmony is crested and we experience disease.
			</div>

			<div class="service">
				<h3>Why do we need to look at your tongue?</h3>
				The tongue is a map of the body. It reflects the general health of the organs and meridians.
				Your acupuncturist will look at the color, shape, cracks and coating on your tongue.
			</div>

			<div class="service">
				<h3>How many treatments are needed?</h3>
				The number of treatments will vary from person to person.
				Some people experience immediate relief, others may take months or even years to achieve results.
				Chronic conditions usually take longer to resolve than acute ones. Plan a minimum of month to see significant changes.
			</div>

			<div class="service">
				<h3>What should I expect during treatment?</h3>
				Where the acupuncture needle has been inserted, you may experience a vague numbness, heaviness, tingling, or dull ache.
				Sometimes people experience a sensation of energy spreading and moving around the needle. This is called the “Qi sensation”.
				All these reactions are good and a sign that the treatment is working.
				After treatment, you may feel energized or may experience a deep sense of relaxation and well being.

				<h3>Acupuncture</h3>
				Acupuncture is an ancient Asian therapy that consists of stimulating designated points with needles to restore and balance the body’s energy, or Qi (pronounced chee).

				Chinese herbs treat the underlying condition as defined by traditional diagnosis, and rarely cause unwanted side-effects.
				Chinese herbs are usually combined in formulas to boost their individual properties and actions.
				Symptoms and signs are matched with therapeutic effects, imitating the particular conditions and needs of each patient.
				Chinese herbal medicine may include vegetable, animal, and mineral ingredients.
				Leaves, flowers, twigs, stems, roots, tubers, rhizome and bark are among the parts of the vegetable used.
				Most of the components of Chinese Herbal Medicine have a very low toxicity compared to even common, over-the-counter Western drugs.
				When they are prescribed according to a correct TCM pattern diagnosis, they should have few, if any side effects.
